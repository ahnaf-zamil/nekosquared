If you want to copy anything from here, such as concepts or a few lines
of code, then... by all means feel free. If you want to be really nice, 
then you could add a little comment into your code citing this repo as a 
reference, but, again, I don't have the right to hunt you down with a r
rifle if you choose not to. It is your decision.

If you are copying large blocks of code, algorithms, or cogs/commands,
then you must include either the license header present above every
source code file in this project. If you need to just reference it in
a short amount of text... I will accept the following:

"""
(c) 2018 Neko404NotFound. Licensed under the MIT license. See
github.com/neko404notfound/nekosquared for full licensing details.
"""

...or words to that effect.

I generally would define a "block of code" as more than, say, 10 
consecutive lines, or a function/class/file.

See https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license for details on MIT.
