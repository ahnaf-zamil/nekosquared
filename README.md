# NekoÂ²

Built from the mistakes and learnings of Neko.

As of 24th April 2018, a copy of Discomaton is packaged with this repository. This is to remove
the need for a second repository purely for the purpose of hosting this mini-library. I may
well add support again in the future if there is any demand for it, but I doubt that will be
necesarry.

## Installation

```python
# Using cURL
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neko404notfound/nekosquared/master/install.py | python3.6
# Using wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neko404notfound/nekosquared/master/install.py | python3.6
```

This downloads the installation script in the root of the repository, and
executes it. This script will clone the repository for you, set up a virtual
environment, install all virtual environment dependencies including discord.py
rewrite, and generate shell scripts for running, and updating the bot.

A sample systemd service file is also produced, as I find this useful.

You need to have `git`, `python3.6` ~~or `python3.7`~~\*, and `pip` installed,
and have the `python3-virtualenv package installed.`

<small> \* There are reports that asyncio is not working correctly on Python3.7 at this
    time, so support is purely 3.6 for the time being.</small>

### Non-python stuff

You will need `libjpeg8` installed to access any modules using imaging.

## Running

To run the bot, you should run the following:

```bash
# On OSX, Unix, Linux
python3.6 -m neko2

# On Windows NT
py -3.6 -m neko2
```

If you do not want any error messages sent to your inbox from the bot regarding
errors whilst the bot is physically online, then you should supply the flag
`--nowarnrun`

### The config files

The bot defaults to the config directory `../neko2config`. This is changeable
by specifying the path as the first command line option when running the bot:

```bash
python3.6 -m neko2 /home/me/my_directory
# or
python3.6 -m neko2 ~/my_directory
```

Config files can have any supported file extension, but they **must** have
one. The file type should be guessed automatically. For example, `discord` will
load either `discord.json`, `discord.py` or `discord.yaml` depending on which
is found first.

The bot currently supports the following serialization formats:

| Extension | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.json` | JSON | Recommended. |
| `.yaml` | YAML | YAML Ain't Markup Language. Requires `pyyaml` to be installed. |
| `.py` | Python | Loads the file and attempts to `eval` it. This risks arbitrary code execution and is untested. | 

The current config files are required for the bot to work:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `discord` | Basic Discord config and authentication. Holds a dictionary of two dictionaries: `bot` and `auth`. `bot` contains `command_prefix` (string) and `owner_id` (int); `auth` contains `client_id` (int) and `token` (string). An additional `debug` boolean config value can be supplied to enable verbose stack traces. This defaults to `false` if unspecified. The `dm_errors` parameter can also be specified to control whether errors get sent to the bot owner's inbox. This defaults to true if not specified. |

Cogs require the following additional configurations:

| Cog | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `urlshorten` | `urlshorten` | [String API key](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) for the `goo.gl` API for URL shortening. |
| `wordnik` | `wordnik` | [String API key](http://developer.wordnik.com/) for the `wordnik` API for dictionary access. |
