# Neko²

Built from the mistakes and learnings of Neko.

## Installation

```python
# Using cURL
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neko404notfound/nekosquared/master/install.py | python3.6
# Using wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neko404notfound/nekosquared/master/install.py | python3.6
```

This downloads the installation script in the root of the repository, and
executes it. This script will clone the repository for you, set up a virtual
environment, install all virtual environment dependencies including discord.py
rewrite, and generate shell scripts for running, and updating the bot.

A sample systemd service file is also produced, as I find this useful.

You need to have `git`, `python3.6` or `python3.7`, and `pip` installed,
and have the `python3-virtualenv package installed.`

## The config files

The bot defaults to the config directory `../neko2config`. This is changeable
by specifying the path as the first command line option when running the bot:

```bash
python3.6 -m neko2 /home/me/my_directory
# or
python3.6 -m neko2 ~/my_directory
```

Config files can have any supported file extension, but they **must** have
one. The file type should be guessed automatically. For example, `discord` will
load either `discord.json`, `discord.py` or `discord.yaml` depending on which
is found first.

The bot currently supports the following serialization formats:

| Extension | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.json` | JSON | Recommended |
| `.yaml` | YAML | Yet Another Markup Language. Requires `pyyaml` to be installed. |
| `.py` | Python | Loads the file and attempts to `eval` it. This risks arbitrary code execution and is untested. | 

The current config files are required for the bot to work:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `discord` | Basic Discord config and authentication. Holds a dictionary of two dictionaries: `bot` and `auth`. `bot` contains `command_prefix` (string) and `owner_id` (int); `auth` contains `client_id` (int) and `token` (string). |
| `database` | Holds PostgreSQL credentials. This is a dictionary of four strings: `database`, `host`, `user`, and `password`. |
| `modules` | Holds a list of fully qualified extensions to load (e.g. `neko2.cogs.latex`) |

Cogs require the following additional configurations:

| Cog | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `neko2.cogs.py` | `neko2.cogs.py.targets` | A list of modules to cache for the `py` command. |
